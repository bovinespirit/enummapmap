EnumMapMap
==========

Based on `containers 5.0`, EnumMapMap provides a series of containers: an
EnumMap, which is an IntMap that uses Enum types instead of Ints, an EnumMap of
EnumMaps, an EnumMap of EnumMaps of EnumMaps and an EnumMap of EnumMaps of
EnumMaps of EnumMaps.

The code ensures that only the root EnumMap can be empty.
